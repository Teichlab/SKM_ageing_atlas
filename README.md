# Human skeletal muscle aging atlas
code to reproduce analyses in the manuscript 

## Contents
### 1. Annotation
- jupyter notebooks for QC, integration and annotation of coarse and fine-grained cell types in the skeltal muscle.

### 2. DE_analysis
- scripts for running single-cell linear mixed effect model (R-based) to evaluate differential gene expression with age accounting for biological and technical covariates (see Supplementary Note 1.3 [in this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34083789/) for detailed explanation of this implementation).

### 3. Figures
- jupyter notebooks to run analyses to reproduce main and extended data figures.
